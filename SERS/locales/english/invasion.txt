HELP_INVASION: <<
	[font=Big]Invasion[/font][vspace=4/]
	You've chosen to play on the [color=#aaffaa]Invasion[/color] map. Here's a few quick tips to get you started!
	[color=#aaa][i]Access this window at any time by pressing the [img=MenuIcons::3;22/] button on the right side of the screen.[/i][/color]

	[font=Medium]Co-operative[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Invasion is a co-operative map. Empires cannot declare war on each other. Diplomatic connivery is A-OK, however![/color]

	[font=Medium]Defense![/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Your home system borders three systems containing remnant defense stations. These systems will be attacked by ever stronger waves of invaders.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Defeat[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]You must [b]protect the Remnant Defense Stations[/b]. When all three stations in a system are dead, the system will explode. When all three of the systems you are defending are gone, your empire will explode.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Maintenance-Free[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Unlike normal maps, your flagships have no maintenance cost, so build as many as you like![/color]

	[font=Medium]Artifact Shards[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]When you defeat a wave of Invaders, they drop an [b]Artifact Shard[/b]. These can be used for free to gain some sort of boost for your empire.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Secondary Shards[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Each artifact shard also has a secondary, more powerful, way to use it. Using this increases the strength of the invading waves for everyone in the game, however![/color]
